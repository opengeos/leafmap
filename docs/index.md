## Introduction

**Leafmap** is a Python package for interactive mapping and geospatial analysis with minimal coding in a Jupyter environment. It is a spin-off project of the [geemap](https://geemap.org) Python package, which was designed specifically to work with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE). However, not everyone in the geospatial community has access to the GEE cloud computing platform. Leafmap is designed to fill this gap for non-GEE users. It is a free and open-source Python package that enables users to analyze and visualize geospatial data with minimal coding in a Jupyter environment, such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and JupyterLab. Leafmap is built upon several open-source packages, such as [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) and [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) (for creating interactive maps), [WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools) and [whiteboxgui](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxgui) (for analyzing geospatial data), and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) (for designing interactive graphical user interfaces [GUIs]). Leafmap has a toolset with various interactive tools that allow users to load vector and raster data onto the map without coding. In addition, users can use the powerful analytical backend (i.e., WhiteboxTools) to perform geospatial analysis directly within the leafmap user interface without writing a single line of code. The WhiteboxTools library currently contains **500+** tools for advanced geospatial analysis, such as [GIS Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/gis_analysis.html), [Geomorphometric Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/geomorphometric_analysis.html), [Hydrological Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/hydrological_analysis.html), [LiDAR Data Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/lidar_tools.html), [Mathematical and Statistical Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/mathand_stats_tools.html), and [Stream Network Analysis](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/stream_network_analysis.html).

## Statement of Need

There is a plethora of Python packages for geospatial analysis, such as [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) for vector data analysis and [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) for raster data analysis. As listed at [pyviz.org](https://pyviz.org/tools.html#geospatial), there are also many options for plotting data on a map in Python, ranging from libraries focused specifically on maps like [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io) and [kepler.gl](https://docs.kepler.gl/docs/keplergl-jupyter) to general-purpose plotting tools that also support geospatial data types, such as [hvPlot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org), [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org), and [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py). These tools provide a lot of power, but displaying geospatial data from various file formats on an interactive map and applying basic analyses can take many lines of code and can be a challenging task for novice users with limited coding skills. Many of the tools also only work "one way", i.e. they can generate maps for display in a browser front end but don't support invoking Python code in response to clicking or selecting items on the map, limiting their utility for exploring map data.

Leafmap is built on the bidirectional communication between the front end (your browser) and the backend (Python) provided by ipleaflet (and similarly by hvPlot and GeoViews) to provide many convenient functions for loading and visualizing geospatial datasets with only one line of code. Users can also use the interactive GUI to load geospatial datasets without coding. Leafmap is intended for anyone who would like to analyze and visualize geospatial data interactively in a Jupyter environment. It is particularly suited for novice users with limited programming skills. Advanced programmers can also find leafmap a useful tool for analyzing geospatial data and building interactive web apps.
